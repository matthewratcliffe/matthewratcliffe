Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Matt â€” I'm a technical lead, senior consultant, coffee drinker, plane flyer, music hopeful, and AI enthusiast based in the small (but mighty!) town of Ballarat, Victoria, Australia.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of building software for organisations of all shapes and sizes â€” from nimble startups to large enterprises and even government agencies â€” all around the world. My work has taken me across a wide range of industry verticals, including grocery, healthcare, education, and even into orbit â€” where Iâ€™ve contributed to software for the International Space Station. ðŸš€

My primary focus is on software that handles highly sensitive personal information. Iâ€™m passionate about unlocking the power of data â€” but equally committed to protecting the dignity and privacy of the individuals that data represents. Designing systems that are both intelligent and responsible is at the heart of what I do.

This repository is a collection of bits and pieces Iâ€™ve written â€” some for myself, some for my local church, and others just because I thought they might help someone out there. I hope it helps you!

Thanks for stopping by!

Cheers,
Matt
